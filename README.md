# Holy Mountain DevKit

## Beta Pre-Release

The Holy Mountain plugin set is meant to elevate and enhance the development process.  By automating select features and alerting the dev to errors in the code, it helps enforce best practices and keeps the developer focused on their main task.  

The philosophy behind the Holy Mountain plugins is simple: everything should be straightforward, easy to understand, and easy to use.  Or in the words of William S. Buroughs: "Do Easy".

## Getting Started

Load the DevKit script first, and then add each of the additional scripts you wish to use.

This current version can easily be linked to via <https://raw.githack.com/>, or downloaded and referenced locally.  Once in the production phase, these plugins will be available on popular Javascript CDNs.

### Prerequisites

jQuery is required.  A future version will automatically detect if you have it installed and load it in if you don't have it.
