# Holy Mountain Dev Enhancement Suite

The Holy Mountain plugin set is meant to elevate and enhance the development process.  By automating select features and alerting the dev to errors in the code, it helps enforce best practices and keeps the developer focused on their main task.  

## Getting Started

Load the DevKit script first, and then add each of the additional scripts you wish to use.

### Prerequisites

jQuery is required.

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo
